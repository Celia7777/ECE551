> 
> "Well, dragons really love to eat, so lets just give them a better option

> 
> You swing by Troll Foods, the local grocery store (yes, run by real

< You agree that mimosas are a great idea. Of course, it seems like you
< should probably make quite a lot of mimosas for a dragon. The two of you
< set off to the local grocery store, Troll Foods (yes, run by real
< trolls--but they are nice) and acquire supplies. You decide on 20 liters of
< orange juice and 20 liters of sparkling wine.
< 
< You take the supplies back to your house and start making mimosas. As you
< do this, you remember the most important thing you learned in Denevieve's
< class: testing is important. The first mimosa is great, but you remember
< that one test case is not enough. After 10 mimosas worth of test cases, you
< are very sure that they are good, but also that you are really drunk. 
< 
< You take your remaining mimosas to the dragon's cave and call out to him 
< 
< "Hey dagron. I've gotss some drinkss and toasht for you."
< 
< The dragon slithers out of his cave intrigued by your offer. As you go to
< make toast, you realize you are too drunk to operate your magic toaster. 
< 
< The dragon eats you instead, while sipping on a mimosa.
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
