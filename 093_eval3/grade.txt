< As you take the magic shoes from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a puff
< of smoke. You decide that you should give the shoes a try before you set
< off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
< school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
< 
< You put on the shoes and start jumping all over the village. As you bound
< over fences and onto the roofs of small houses, your fellow villagers look
< at you in awe. You are sure you could win any basketball game but are a
< little more worried about how you will deal with a dragon.
< 
< Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
< not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
< alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
< other hand, help might be useful.
< 
< Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
< live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
< decide whom to go to for help.
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
<  2. Go to Grew for help.
<  3. Go alone.
< As you take the magic toaster from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
< puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the toaster a try before you
< set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
< school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
< 
< Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster
< seems like a great solution to two problems. You grab a rock off the
< ground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A few
< seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
< amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
< testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
< stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
< dragon. 
< 
< Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
< not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
< alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the

< 
< Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
< live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
< decide whom to go to for help.
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
<  2. Go to Grew for help.
<  3. Go alone.
< After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a
< better choice. After all, her singing skills are likely to come in handy,
< especially with your magic whistle. Maybe dragons can be tamed by choir
< music and bird calls? That could be right, but you aren't sure--you slept
< through that day of Magical Creature Biology class. 
< 
< After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
< threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
< tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
< trusted with a quest about dragons.
< 
< The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
< take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
< list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon. 
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
<  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
<  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Grew is the best
< choice. You go to visit him, and explain your plan: Grew will make some
< cinnamon almond cupcakes with dark chocolate ganache, and you will seranade
< the dragon with your bird calls. Together, you will put the dragon in such
< a good mood that you can befriend him and convince him to leave your
< villages alone. 
< 
< Sadly, while the dragon does find the cupcakes delicious, he wants
< something else to go with them. 
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go alone. You head off
< into the hills by yourself in search of the dragon. Unfortunately, while
< you are walking and trying to think up a plan, the dragon swoops down
< behind you and devours you. 
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide Denevieve is a better
< choice. After all she teaches undergraduate Dynamics, so surely that can
< help you fight a dragon? 
< 
< After you explain your quest and demonstrate your magic shoes, Denevieve
< pulls out a whiteboard and explains how to make it work: 
< 
< "First, we need to model the dragon as a rigid body and your magic shoes as
< a point mass. Then we apply Lagrange’s Equations and... hmm this would be
< much easier if the dragon's cave were a frictionless surface, but we
< probably can't assume that, so instead (she writes big complicated equation
< and does a bunch of calculus)... Ok, you need to jump right here on the top
< of the dragon's head." She says, indicating a point on the dragon's head in
< her free-body diagram. 
< 
< The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and you carefully jump at
< exactly the right place while Denevieve distracts the dragon with a lecture
< about Coulomb friction. Your mighty jump knocks the dragon
< unconscious. While the dragon is passed out, you tie him up.
< 
< When the dragon wakes up, you work out an agreement where the dragon will
< learn C++ programming and earn his food by writing software instead of
< stealing it. 
< 
< Everyone lives happily ever after.
< 
< Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. Grew
< thinks about your problem for a while, and the best idea he can come up
< with is to challenge the dragon to a game of basketball. After all, you do
< have magic shoes that would let you dunk quite easily. 
< 
< The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and the dragon agrees to your
< challenge. Unfortunately, even being able to jump 10 feet in the air, the
< dragon, who is 20 feet tall and can fly, can still block all your shots and
< dunk over your head. The dragon wins the game and eats both you and Grew.
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
< 
< "Mama, just killed a man"
< "Put a gun against his head"
< "Pulled my trigger, now he's dead"
< "Mama, life had just begun"
< "But now I've gone and thrown it all away"
< 
< As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
< cave looking quite amused. He sings along with you all for a while, but
< when you hit "Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth"
< 
< the dragon roars "INDEED YOU DO! AND THE TRUTH IS YOU LOOK TASTY!"
< 
< The dragon eats you.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Denevieve is the better
< choice. You go to her house and explain your quest. 
< 
< "Why don't we make some mimosas to go with the toast, and take them to the
< dragon? That would surely placate him," she suggests. 
< 
< You agree that mimosas are a great idea. Of course, it seems like you
< should probably make quite a lot of mimosas for a dragon. The two of you
< set off to the local grocery store, Troll Foods (yes, run by real
< trolls--but they are nice) and acquire supplies. You decide on 20 liters of
< orange juice and 20 liters of sparkling wine.
< 
< You take the supplies back to your house and start making mimosas. As you
< do this, you remember the most important thing you learned in Denevieve's
< class: testing is important. The first mimosa is great, but you remember
< that one test case is not enough. After 10 mimosas worth of test cases, you
< are very sure that they are good, but also that you are really drunk. 
< 
< You take your remaining mimosas to the dragon's cave and call out to him 
< 
< "Hey dagron. I've gotss some drinkss and toasht for you."
< 
< The dragon slithers out of his cave intrigued by your offer. As you go to
< make toast, you realize you are too drunk to operate your magic toaster. 
< 
< The dragon eats you instead, while sipping on a mimosa.
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. When
< you explain your quest, and that you have a magic toaster, Grew gets an
< idea. 
< 
< "Well, dragons really love to eat, so lets just give them a better option
< than the animals in the area!" Grew exclaims. He goes on to explain how you
< will create the best all-you-can-eat brunch buffet ever. Grew will arrange
< for berries, smoked salmon, pastries, and you will provide literally
< all-you-can-eat toast with the magic toaster. 
< 
< You swing by Troll Foods, the local grocery store (yes, run by real
< trolls--but they are nice trolls) and pick up the supplies: 10 kg of smoked
< salmon, 20 kg of mixed berries, and 100 pastries.
< 
< Upon arriving at the dragon's cave, you lay out the buffet and start making
< toast. The dragon is so happy with the food, and thrilled that he can make
< all the toast he wants, that he agrees to stop eating people's farm
< animals, on one condition: you and Grew have to come back each week and
< have brunch with him.
< 
< You all live happily ever after.
< 
< Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
< You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
< 
< "Angels we have heard on high" (COCKADOODLEDO)
< "Sweetly singing o'er the plains" (COCKADOODLEDO).
< "And the mountains in reply" (COCKADOODLEDO).
< "Echoing their joyous strains" (COCKADOODLEDO).
< 
< As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
< cave looking quite angry. 
< 
< "WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."
< 
< The dragon eats you.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
< You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
< 
< "Si--iii-lent niiight" (CAW CAW CAW)
< "Ho--oly night" (CAW CAW).
< "Aaaalll iiss calm aaaalll is bright" (CAW CAW).
< 
< As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
< cave looking quite angry. 
< 
< "WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."

< One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that

<  3. Choose the magic toaster.
< move page4
< As you take the magic toaster from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
< puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the toaster a try before you
< set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
< school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
< 
< Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster
< seems like a great solution to two problems. You grab a rock off the
< ground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A few
< seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
< amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
< testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
< stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
< dragon. 
< 
< Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
< not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
< alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
< other hand, help might be useful.
< 
< Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
< live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
< decide whom to go to for help.
< 
< What would you like to do?
< 
<  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
<  2. Go to Grew for help.
<  3. Go alone.
< move page11
< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Denevieve is the better
< choice. You go to her house and explain your quest. 
< 
< "Why don't we make some mimosas to go with the toast, and take them to the
< dragon? That would surely placate him," she suggests. 
< 
< You agree that mimosas are a great idea. Of course, it seems like you
< should probably make quite a lot of mimosas for a dragon. The two of you
< set off to the local grocery store, Troll Foods (yes, run by real
< trolls--but they are nice) and acquire supplies. You decide on 20 liters of
< orange juice and 20 liters of sparkling wine.
< 
< You take the supplies back to your house and start making mimosas. As you
< do this, you remember the most important thing you learned in Denevieve's
< class: testing is important. The first mimosa is great, but you remember
< that one test case is not enough. After 10 mimosas worth of test cases, you
< are very sure that they are good, but also that you are really drunk. 
< 
< You take your remaining mimosas to the dragon's cave and call out to him 
< 
< "Hey dagron. I've gotss some drinkss and toasht for you."
< 
< The dragon slithers out of his cave intrigued by your offer. As you go to
< make toast, you realize you are too drunk to operate your magic toaster. 
< 
< The dragon eats you instead, while sipping on a mimosa.
< 
< You have been eaten by a dragon.
< 
< Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

< You do not learn to program.
